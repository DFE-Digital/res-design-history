In terms of coming up with a deliverable solution, there was a decision to be made around the platform that the the site should sit on.

We considered a number of things, including content types within [Whitehall Publisher](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/introduction-and-access-to-whitehall-publisher), and how much flexibility that would give us.

We also discussed a more bespoke solution that could be hosted on a subdomain of education.gov.uk, and give us a little more flexibility with the information architecture - but still adhering to the [gov.uk design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

To help inform the decision we tested two pages with a small number of users.

The first page was designed to reflect how a page created in Whitehall Publisher might look:

The second page was designed using a slightly more experimental layout with a 'card' pattern for the different sections:

![alt text goes here, innit](/images/platform/Get-help-with-remote-education_landing.png)

Both versions tested well but it was felt that the second version was easier to scan, with potentially less scrolling needed.

Ultimately the platform decision was based on a number of factors including development considerations, timelines and costs, but from a design perspective it was felt that the more bespoke route of our own hosted subdomain would enable us to better meet users' needs.
