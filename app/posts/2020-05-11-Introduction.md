Get help with remote education was brought about to try and reduce the amount of time schools spend finding the support and information they need around their provision of remote learning, during the disruption caused by COVID 19.

There was already a guidance page on gov.uk with a raft of content aimed at schools and further education, but it was a very long, single page that wasn’t particularly easy to scan or quickly identify key elements.

Our early UR activities - a combination of interviews and card sort exercises - helped us to identify some core user needs, and ‘how might we’ questions:

* how might we help users understand quickly from the homepage, what support is available?
* how might we help users find content that is relevant  to them?
* how might we show users what’s new and what’s been updated?

We used this as our starting point for initial design solutions.
